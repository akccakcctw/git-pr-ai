# Introduction

Git PR AI Tool is a powerful command-line tool that automates Pull Request creation for GitHub and GitLab with JIRA integration. It streamlines your development workflow by automatically extracting JIRA ticket numbers from branch names and creating well-structured PRs with AI assistance.

## Key Features

- üöÄ **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with both GitHub and GitLab repositories
- üîç **JIRA Integration**: Can integrate with JIRA to fetch ticket information
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Leverages Claude Code and Gemini for smart content generation and code analysis
- üéØ **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands your repository without manual input

## Quick Start

1. **Install the tool globally:**

   ```bash
   pnpm add -g git-pr-ai
   ```

2. **Configure JIRA integration** (required for git-pr-ai to fetch JIRA data):

   ```bash
   # Set up JIRA connection to fetch ticket information
   git pr-ai config
   ```

3. **Create a branch from JIRA ticket:**

   ```bash
   # Generates branch name following commitlint conventions
   git create-branch --jira PROJ-123
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request:**

   ```bash
   # Automatically fetches JIRA ID and title for PR creation
   git open-pr
   ```

5. **Update PR description with AI:**

   ```bash
   # Directly updates the PR description using AI analysis
   git update-pr-desc
   ```

6. **PR review with AI:**

   ```bash
   # Uses AI to review code and provide feedback
   git pr-review
   ```

That's it! The tool handles the rest automatically.

## How It Works

The Git PR AI Tool integrates seamlessly with your existing Git workflow:

1. **Create Branch**: `git create-branch --jira PROJ-123` fetches JIRA ticket details and generates an appropriate branch name
2. **Make Changes**: Work on your feature/fix as usual with your standard Git workflow
3. **Open PR**: `git open-pr` automatically creates a pull request with JIRA ticket information and smart titles
4. **Enhance with AI**: `git update-pr-desc` uses AI to analyze your changes and generate comprehensive descriptions
5. **Review & Merge**: `git pr-review` provides AI-powered code review feedback before merging
